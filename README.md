# Yieldstark: Multi-Strategy Liquid Staking Protocol

## Overview

Yieldstark is a specialized liquid staking protocol built on Polkadot that generates **ysDOT** (Yieldstark Staked DOT), a rebasing derivative token representing a diversified basket of staked DOT assets across multiple parachain liquid staking protocols.

## Documentation

This repository contains comprehensive documentation for the Yieldstark protocol design and architecture:

- **[Executive Summary](./EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md)** - High-level overview, value proposition, and roadmap
- **[Protocol Overview](./PROTOCOL_OVERVIEW.md)** - Complete protocol concept, mechanics, and design principles
- **[Architecture](./ARCHITECTURE.md)** - Technical architecture, component design, and system flows
- **[Token Mechanics](./TOKEN_MECHANICS.md)** - Detailed rebasing token mechanics and mathematical models
- **[Integrations](./INTEGRATIONS.md)** - Parachain integration guides (Bifrost, Acala, etc.)
- **[Resources](./RESOURCES.md)** - Links, addresses, documentation, and reference materials
- **[Architecture Diagrams](./ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAMS.md)** - Complete visual reference with Mermaid diagrams

## Key Features

- **Multi-Strategy Approach**: Aggregates yield from multiple parachain liquid staking protocols
- **Rebasing Mechanism**: Automatic reward accrual through supply adjustments
- **Yield Optimization**: Intelligent allocation across protocols for maximum returns
- **Cross-Chain Integration**: XCM-based communication with Polkadot parachains
- **DeFi Ready**: Stable exchange rate enables seamless DeFi integration

## Quick Start

1. Read the [Protocol Overview](./PROTOCOL_OVERVIEW.md) to understand the concept
2. Review the [Architecture](./ARCHITECTURE.md) for technical details
3. Study [Token Mechanics](./TOKEN_MECHANICS.md) for rebasing implementation
4. Check [Integrations](./INTEGRATIONS.md) for parachain integration details
5. Reference [Resources](./RESOURCES.md) for links and addresses
